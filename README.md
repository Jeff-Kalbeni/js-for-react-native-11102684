## Task1
The function processArray() takes a number array as argument and generates a new array using the Map method. The new array doubles an entry if it is even and triples it, if otherwise.

## Task2
A new function formatArrayStrings() has been introduced which takes two arguments. It takes two arguments, the first one is a string and the second is an array from processArray(). It throws an error if the length of the arrays are not the same otherwise it proceeds. It returns a new array with each string at the same index as an even number in the array from the second argument, capitalized. And converts the rest to lowercase.

## Task3
Here, a new function createUserProfiles() has been created which also takes two arrays as arguments. Both arrays must be strings. It throws an error if the length of the arrays are not equal, then, returns a new array using the Map method. The second argument is an array from the formatArrayStrings() in Task2.
